 
Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹


I am Bhavishya Malla, currently a senior at Penn State University, majoring in computer science whilst minoring in statistics. 

I'm currently working on a sentiment analysis project that will measure the impact of the election of 2024 on different sectors in America that would be utilized to extrapolate predictive insights about future political events. 

Feel free to reach me at bmdllu33@gmail.com.
